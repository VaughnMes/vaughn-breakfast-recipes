                    <span>No complicated ingredients.</span> Many vegan pancake recipes contain a long ingredient list, but I
                    wanted to keep this fluffy
                    vegan pancake recipe as simple as possible. No flax egg, funky flour substitutes, or expensive sugar
                    alternatives.

                    just like the real thing and are approved by hundreds
                    of pancake lovers.

        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <span>Almond milk</span> - I love using lightly sweetened, original Almond Breeze, but really any plant milk
                    will do. Coconut milk, soy milk, or
                    oat milk are great choices.
                </li>
            
                <li>
                    <span>Apple cider vinegar</span> - This acid helps the almond milk curdle and creates your own vegan buttermilk.
                    White vinegar is another option, if you
                    are out of apple cider vinegar.
                </li>
            
                <li>
                    <span>Flour</span> - For the fluffiest vegan pancakes, Iâ€™d recommend using the classic all-purpose flour. or a
                    combination of regular flour
                    and whole wheat flour. If you are gluten-free, a gluten-free flour blend such as Bobâ€™s Red Mill will work.
                </li>
            
                <li>
                    <span>Baking powder</span> â€“ The key to making the pancakes tall and thick.
                </li>
            
                <li>
                    <span>Sugar</span> - A couple tablespoons of granulated sugar adds a light sweetness. I used granulated cane
                    sugar, but another sugar such as
                    light brown sugar or coconut sugar are alternative options.
                </li>
            
                <li>
                    <span>Oil</span> â€“ Helps keep the pancake batter soft, fluffy, and adds a nice, cozy flavour. Any light tasting
                    oil will do â€“ try olive
                    oil, avocado oil, vegetable oil or even melted coconut oil.

        <ol>
            <li>Combine the Almond Breeze Original Almondmilk and apple cider vinegar, stirring well. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In a mixing bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, sugar and salt.</li>
            <li>Add the oil to the almondmilk mixture and stir. Then pour into dry mixture.</li>
            <li>Mix until JUST combined. Lumps are okay! Do not over-mix. See video for what the batter should look like.</li>
            <li>Heat a frying pan to medium heat. Spray oil lightly onto pan.</li>
            <li>Using scoop batter into round pancake shapes, leaving some room for spreading. I usually do 2 at a time. BE
                PATIENT! Let
                it cook until bubbles rise to the surface then burst, and the edges start to look cooked. Take a peak underneath
                and if
                it is golden, flip to the other side. Cook about 30 seconds-1 minute on the other side (the second side takes
                much less
                time to cook).</li>
