        <p>I have been experimenting with this pancake recipe for a while, and am finally ready to share the perfect pancake
        recipe. I LOVE pancakes that are light and fluffy and thick, but still simple enough to whip up in the morning and these
        check every box.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>No complicated ingredients.</strong> Many vegan pancake recipes contain a long ingredient list, but I wanted to keep this fluffy
                vegan pancake recipe as simple as possible. No flax egg, funky flour substitutes, or expensive sugar alternatives.

            <li>

                just like the real thing and are approved by hundreds
                of pancake lovers.

        <h1>Key Ingredients and Substitutions</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Almond milk</strong> - I love using lightly sweetened, original Almond Breeze, but really any plant milk will do. Coconut milk, soy milk, or
                oat milk are great choices.
            </li>
            
            <li>
               <strong>Apple cider vinegar</strong> - This acid helps the almond milk curdle and creates your own vegan buttermilk. White vinegar is another option, if you
                are out of apple cider vinegar.
            </li>

            <li>
               <strong>Flour</strong> - For the fluffiest vegan pancakes, Iâ€™d recommend using the classic all-purpose flour. or a combination of regular flour
                and whole wheat flour. If you are gluten-free, a gluten-free flour blend such as Bobâ€™s Red Mill will work.
            </li>

            <li>
               <strong>Baking powder</strong> â€“ The key to making the pancakes tall and thick.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Sugar</strong> - A couple tablespoons of granulated sugar adds a light sweetness. I used granulated cane sugar, but another sugar such as
                light brown sugar or coconut sugar are alternative options.
            </li>

            <li>
               <strong>Oil</strong> â€“ Helps keep the pancake batter soft, fluffy, and adds a nice, cozy flavour. Any light tasting oil will do â€“ try olive
                oil, avocado oil, vegetable oil or even melted coconut oil.
            </li>
        </ul>

    <h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
    </p>

    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the Almond Breeze Original Almondmilk and apple cider vinegar, stirring well. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In a mixing bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, sugar and salt.</li>
            <li>Add the oil to the almondmilk mixture and stir. Then pour into dry mixture.</li>
            <li>Mix until JUST combined. Lumps are okay! Do not over-mix. See video for what the batter should look like.</li>
            <li>Heat a frying pan to medium heat. Spray oil lightly onto pan.</li>
            <li>Using scoop batter into round pancake shapes, leaving some room for spreading. I usually do 2 at a time. BE PATIENT! Let
            it cook until bubbles rise to the surface then burst, and the edges start to look cooked. Take a peak underneath and if
            it is golden, flip to the other side. Cook about 30 seconds-1 minute on the other side (the second side takes much less
            time to cook).</li>
        </ol>
